Projects
=====

Project contents introduce basic practical knowledge different to the contents of the lectures. To cover the simple knowledge and programming issues, we will have 6 lab times in this semester (in our class time, no additional lab times are assigned.) 
- Lab 0, 1, 2, 3 : will be uploaded every 2 weeks 
- Lab 4, 5 : will be uploaded every 3 weeks
---

CHECK the key date of each assignment: (To be uploaded; Q&A Session; Deadline)
- *To be uploaded*: the slide and video about the introduction of Lab N will be upload on time (not real-time). You can start from this date. 
- *Q&A Session*: interactive Q&A Session will be held on time (on Zoom meeting; real-time).   
- *Deadline*: you should submit your assignment before the deadline
